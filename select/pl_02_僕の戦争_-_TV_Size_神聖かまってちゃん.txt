Let's start a new life
from the darkness
Until the light reveals the end
Sinister faces, growing curses
This is my last war
Angels playing disguised
with devil's faces
Children cling to their coins
squeezing
out their wisdom
Angels planning disguised
with devil's faces
Children cling on to their
very last coins
Destruction and regeneration
You are the real enemy
